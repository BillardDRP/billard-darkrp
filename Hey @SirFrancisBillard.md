Hey @SirFrancisBillard

I had an idea for billardRP

Better government:
If a mayor has imposed/enforced many very strict rules over the citizens, then groups of citizens can form a rebellion in an attemp to overthrow the government, however if they are caught they will be jailed. Guards and other government members can also offer bribes to citizens that they believe may be a part of the mob. These citizens can either lie or snitch (if they actually are part of it) these bribes can be money, safety, jobs, or weapons. 

Thanks!
